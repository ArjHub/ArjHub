### Hi there 👋
![Profile Picture](https://github.com/ArjHub/ArjHub/blob/main/profile.png)

👋 Hi, I'm Arjun, a Cloud Data Engineer passionate about building reliable, automated, and scalable data solutions.

💡 I specialize in designing data pipelines, automating workflows, and working with cloud services to make data accessible, secure, and production-ready. I enjoy solving complex engineering challenges and improving systems through efficient, well-structured code.

☁️ With hands-on experience in AWS, ETL pipeline development, Python scripting, SharePoint data extraction, and automation, I focus on creating solutions that are robust, cost-efficient, and easy to maintain.

⚙️ I'm also an active open-source contributor and continuously explore new tools and technologies to enhance my engineering skills.

💻 Open to collaborating with teams building data-driven products, cloud-native applications, or automation-focused solutions.

📫 Feel free to reach out at heyaitzarjun@gmail.com — always happy to connect and work on impactful ideas!

🔭 Always exploring new ways to optimize pipelines, improve data flows, and build better cloud-native systems.

⚡ Fun fact: The first ever “computer bug” was literally a bug — a moth stuck inside the Harvard Mark II in 1947.
